Robert Roberts (1905â€“1974) was an English writer, 
teacher and social historian, noted for the evocative accounts of 
his working-class youth he gave in The Classic Slum (1971) and A Ragged 
Schooling (1976). Born and raised in a deprived district of Salford, Roberts 
left school at 14 for a seven-year apprenticeship as a brass finisher. 
Sacked once it ended, he spent three years unemployed, and attended evening 
classes. In 1929, he was hired as a teacher at a commercial college, but was 
dismissed in 1940 when he was exempted from conscription as a conscientious 
objector. He then spent years working as a farmhand, as well as teaching and 
writing. In 1957, he was hired to teach at Strangeways Prison in Manchester; 
his experiences there inspired his first book, Imprisoned Tongues (1968). 
In 1971, Roberts published The Classic Slum, a book about his boyhood, 
intermixed with social and oral history. Widely praised, it has become a 
key source for understanding the working-class experience in early-20th-century
